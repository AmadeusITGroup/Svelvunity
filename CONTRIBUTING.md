## Project Overview

Svelvunity is a UI component library built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that helps developers build websites faster. By leveraging this library, developers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to build UI elements for their projects. Instead of starting from scratch, they can integrate ready-made components into their applications, saving valuable development time and resources.

## Getting Started

If you wish to experiment with Svelvunity on your local machine:

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open the page http://localhost:5173

For more information on the various commands you can run locally, please refer to the [DEVELOPER](./DEVELOPER.md) documentation.
